    <div class="title">Dialectical Materialism; Diamat</div>
<p> 
    Dialectical Materialism shows that people's thoughts, characters and actions are shaped by the environment in which they live, and that the environment is, in turn, shaped by human social relations.
    In a capitalist society, for example, people are driven by the need to make money and accumulate wealth. This shapes people's thoughts, characters and actions, and leads to the development of a capitalist system, in which the environment is shaped by the needs of capitalists.
    Dialectical materialism allows people to perceive the logical progression of beliefs, thoughts, actions and occurrences, and even the course of human history as a whole.
    This allows them to see the world clearly by revealing underlying forces that shape it.

    <div class="title">Philosophy</div>
    <p>Philosophers typically engage in critical thinking about fundamental questions about knowledge, reality, morality, and values. They often seek to clarify, challenge, or refine common-sense beliefs or assumptions. Many philosophers also contribute to the development of new theories and criticisms of existing ones. Marxist philosopher are the same as other philosophers. Marxist philosophers engage in critical analysis of Marxist theory and often focus on questions related to the nature of capitalism, class conflict, and the possibility of a socialist future. This section will be like a Diamat Part Two.

    <div class="title">Black Liberation Movement</div>
    <p>The Black Liberation movement is a social movement that seeks to achieve cultural, social, and structural liberation for black people. The goals of the movement vary depending on the particular focus or goals of the organization or individual involved, but usually include things such as ending police brutality, increasing access to education and employment, and combating housing discrimination. As for black women specifically, there is no single definition for black women's liberation from misogynoir, as it is an evolving and complex concept. In general though, misgynoir refers to the unique ways in which black women experience sexism and racism, and the efforts to resist and transform these forms of oppression. This includes everything from intersectional feminist theory and activism to popular culture and art. Broadly speaking, black women’s liberation from misogynoir also entails challenging and ultimately upending the various systems of oppression that target black women specifically because of both their race and gender. This includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, and homophobia.

    <p>In general, liberation for LGBTQ+ people refers to the idea of achieving full social, political, and economic equality and inclusion. This may involve working to end discrimination and violence against LGBTQ+ people, fighting for LGBTQ+ people to have the same rights and protections as everyone else, and working to create inclusive environments where everyone can feel safe and affirmed. Trans people have long been fighting to normalize their identity by living their lives openly and authentically, and by speaking out against the discrimination and violence that they face. In recent years, there has been a growing movement of trans people and their allies working to raise awareness about the issues facing the trans community and to push for social, political, and economic inclusion. This work has included everything from advocating for trans rights to working to improve the visibility and representation of trans people in the media.

    <p>The Working Class, or Proletariat, is the class of people who do not own the means of production and who are exploited by the ruling class. Working class liberation is the emancipation of working class people from subordination and exploitation. It includes the struggle for equality and democracy within society, as well as the economic struggle for better working conditions, wages, and social benefits. It also typically encompasses the fight against racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination.
