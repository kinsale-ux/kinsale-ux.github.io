    <p class="fixed black">Praxis is a concept derived from the marxian concept of dialectical materialism; it is the practical application of the Marxist and other related theories to the analysis and transformation of social and political contexts. It is often used to refer to the specific practice of revolutionary praxis, which involves the collective struggle of oppressed people and social classes for liberation from oppressive forces. The idea of praxis was first developed by Karl Marx, who argued that the application of theory to practice was necessary for the development of a revolutionary praxis. <br>
      Marx argued that praxis was not simply the application of theory, but rather the synthesis of theory and practice towards the achievement of a revolutionary goal. Marx argued that praxis was the only way to achieve a revolutionary transformation of society, and he described it as the "practical application of the theory of scientific socialism." In this sense, praxis refers to the use of theoretical knowledge in practical action. This includes the use of analysis and critical understanding to develop effective strategies and tactics to challenge existing power structures, and to work towards the transformation of oppressive social conditions. In this sense, praxis is the practice of using theoretical knowledge to inform and drive practical action and it is often used to refer to the specific practice of revolutionary praxis, which involves the collective struggle of oppressed people and social classes for liberation from oppressive forces.

      This website is a project that was founded in pursuit of understanding of praxis and to contribute to the withering of the state. Our aim is to foster education and provoke empathy. We are doing our part in the revolutionary work to transform our culture and society. Through praxis we will make our mark and influence the rise in power <br> for the working class people; By the working class people.
